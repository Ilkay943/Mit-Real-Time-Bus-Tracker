# Mit-Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description
In this exercise we use our map token and we created a Boston Map.

We have added bus stops between Harvard and Mit campus.

Finally, we created a button that follows bus stops thru the way between Harvard and Mit.

## How to Run

First you should clone repository and then open the index.htmk in your browser. It will show movement of bus between Mit and Harvard Campuses in Boston.

## Further Improvments

With our map token we can apply different cities and different bus stops on this exercise. Also we can create a personolized bus tracking website.
